		<t><i>Bud, Not Buddy</i> is a heart warming adventure that will always have a place on my bookshelf. 
		This story of preserverance takes place at the height of the Great Depression where Buddy Caldwell, a 
		now six year old orphan, struggles to find where he belongs. After the death of his mother, he gets 
		sucked into the foster care system. Having knowledge of his father's existence Bud battles through the 
		mistreatings of his new foster family, the Amoses, and makes a break for a quest to find this blood 
		related local band leader. On the way, many themes outline his journey. Of which includes when one 
		oppurtunity vanishes, another appears. There is a strong sense of divine intervention at some points
		that shed light on the idea that every time something good or bad happens, there is always a choice
		for young Caldwell to make. Another theme, which is the most impactful I beleive, is the historical
		reality of segregation. Going through all of Bud's characteristics the one that initially (and sadly)
		defines him is his skin color. This plays a paramount role in all of his actions throughout the entire
		story. There is a point in the selection where Bud ends up in Hooverville, described as a "cardboard
		jungle." Here there is an overwhelming feeling of what black people endured during a tough time for
		all Americans. Blacks were treated as, pretty much, second class citizens.
