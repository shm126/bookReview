		<div><h3>Summary</h3></div>
		<em>Bud, Not Buddy</em> covers the story of a black 10 year old from the 
			30's who goes from living a tough orphan life in Flint, Michigan
			to finding his place alongside his mother's family. Just four years after
			his mother's death, he is placed in a foster home with the
			Amos family who's 12-year old son, Todd, torments and bullies
			Bud. This results in Bud running away encountering numerous obstacles.
			New friends, disguised vampires, crazed hornets, racist racists, 
			muskrat stew, and cool jazz bands are all a part of his journey. Just
			remember that the name's Bud, not Buddy.
